# AES and Encryption Modes #

AES is a widely used cipher with no known vulnerabilities. But, like any block cipher, it needs to be used with a block encryption mode. As Wikipedia states:

> A block cipher by itself is only suitable for the secure cryptographic transformation (encryption or decryption) of one fixed-length group of bits called a block. A mode of operation describes how to repeatedly apply a cipherâ€™s single-block operation to securely transform amounts of data larger than a block.

## Learning Objectives ##

- Apply secret-key cryptography using openssl and different ciphers
- Describe differences between operating modes w.r.t. confidentiality
- Describe differences between operating modes w.r.t. integrity
- Describe the PKCS5 padding scheme and the operating modes that need padding

# Part 1: Encryption using different ciphers and modes #

In this task, we will experiment with various encryption algorithms and modes. You will be using the `openssl` tool for this purpose. Use the `openssl enc` command to encrypt/decrypt a file. To see the manuals, you can type `man openssl` and `man enc`. Below is an example command:

	openssl enc <ciphertype> -e -in plain.txt -out cipher.bin -K 00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff -iv 0102030405060708

Please replace the *ciphertype* with a specific AES cipher type, such as `-aes-128-cbc`, `-aes-128-cfb`, and `-aes-128-ofb`. In this task, you should try at least 3 different ciphers and three different modes. you can find the meaning of the command-line options and all the supported cipher types by typing `man enc`. Below are some common options for the openssl enc command:

| -in <file> | input file |
| -out <file> | output file |
| -e | encrypt |
| -d | decrypt |
| -K/-iv | key/iv in hex is the next argument |
| -[pP] | print the iv/key (then exit if -P) |
