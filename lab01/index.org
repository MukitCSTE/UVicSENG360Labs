* Passwords Crossword Puzzle

Our first lab will consist in solving a crossword puzzle. The idea of a puzzle was inspired by [[http://xkcd.com/1286/][xkcd]]:

[[./encryptic.png]]

For this lab you will need two files: the crossword puzzle (found here) and the datafile that you can download from connex (under resources).

** Your job

In groups of 2 or 3 people, try to solve as many clues as you can.

** The clues.

Each clue is a hashed password. The key problem with these passwords is that they were encrypted without a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)][salt]]. This means that if two people used the same
password, then the hash would be identical. 

The hash does not tell us much (it is likely it is a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function][one-way hash function]], anyways). But the leaked data also had the user's hint that the user would use to
remember the password. In general, one clue would not be of much use, but because we have lots of clues for every hashed password, they can be useful. For
example, these are /clues/ for the hashed password ~EQ7fIpT7i/Q=~ which appeared a total of 1,911,867 times in the data. These are the top "clues" to this
password, along with their frequency. Can you guess what the password is?

** Your job

Solve this crossword puzzle. You will need the passwords file. That is in connex under resources/labs/lab01. This file is very simple:

Its format is simple: three fields, separated by =|=. The first is the frequency of the combination =<password,hint>=. The second is the hashed password, and
the third the hint.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
1|nPay03ioxG6CatHBw==|Lol, forgot again? Just remember. E-mail.
5758|eONYUIJwFakd6VkaOIVkcg==|my pet
...
#+END_EXAMPLE

You can either use command line tools (grep, cut, uniq, etc) or write one or more programs to solve the puzzle. Good luck!

** What to submit

Submit a paper copy of your puzzle solved at the end of the lab.
